# CSC-20063-Software-Dev-Project

The project's objective is to provide the public with information about COVID-19 case spikes in specific geographical locations within a defined timeframe. We aim to develop user-friendly software with an easily accessible interface that utilises COVID-19 data. This information will help customers assess whether they may have been exposed to COVID-19 during a particular period, especially if they did not take a lateral flow test. Additionally, the software can be used for checking COVID-19 levels in locations before traveling there.

N.B. the application uses a database that has not been uploaded here due to size but the files contained within this repository allow the building of this database.
